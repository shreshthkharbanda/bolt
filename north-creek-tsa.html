                                    <p>The North Creek High School Technology Student Association chapter was founded 2 years ago by Aneesh Karpoor and Abi Chandru. The board of advisors include Spencer Teachout, Jeff Stride, and Chad Steinbaugh. It is devoted to students interested in such career fields as architecture, engineering, construction, manufacturing, film/video production, graphic arts, or other technical areas. They ensure that every student receives the help they need either through mentors or advisors and teachers along with giving them a means to interact and collaborate with like minded peers. North Creek TSA also has a high level of organization and guide every member step by step so they can achieve their full potential. Overall, the North Creek High School Technology Student Association chapter is one of the very best chapters in the district!</p>

                                <span>Jeff Stride grew up in San Jose, California, in the heart of Silicon Valley. He attended Cupertino High School, which is just a few blocks from the home base of Apple. His first computer was an Apple II+, and he proudly displays this very same machine in my classroom today, completely functional! He interned at NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View for several years, where he did FORTRAN programming to graph Blackhawk helicopter airfoil data in 3D and learned in a very painstaking way how to do technical writing. He has a diverse college experience, having first attended a community college, then Brown University, then San Jose State University, and finally UC Santa Barbara.</span>
                                <span><br /><br />He has wanted to be a teacher since he was in high school; he tutored math for many years and volunteered in various classrooms. When he completed his bachelor's degree, he nearly started his teaching certification process then. But, the allure of studying Computer Science alongside the beaches of Santa Barbara was the winner. Microsoft brought him to the northwest and provided a career for him. Now, he teaches Introduction to Computer Science Principles, AP Computer Science Principles, AP Computer Science A, and will teach Advanced Programming Topics 1 & 2 starting next year at North Creek High School.</span>

                                <span>Bill Rosenthal has been teaching in Northshore School District for about ten years. He was at North Creek last year and the previous nine were spent at Skyview Junior High (now a middle school). Prior to teaching he spent 28 years as an Art Director in San Francisco. His first job out of art school was using clay to create design prototypes for the Jawa Sandcrawler in what we thought would be a little movie: Star Wars: A New Hope. Prior to art school I was a combat photographer in the U.S. Navy. I was born in Minnesota but spent my entire youth living in Compton, California. Classes taught: Digital Photography, Advanced Digital Photography, Graphic Design, Advanced Graphic Design, Yearbook. Education background: BFA, Sculpture.

                        Diploma Category: O</br>
                        In this course, students will learn the fundamentals of computing – including problem solving, working with data, understanding the internet, cybersecurity, and programming. Students completing this course should leave with a broadened understanding of computer science for use in diverse majors and careers. Those wanting to earn AP credit will submit two “through-course performance tasks” to the College Board for grading, and will take a multiple-choice end-of-year exam. This course is not a prerequisite for AP Computer Science A, but AP Computer Science A is the logical follow-up class for students inspired to study computer science more deeply after completing this class.

                        Diploma Category: O</br>
                        This course introduces students to the fundamentals of computer science by teaching Java, an object oriented programming language.  No prior programming experience is necessary to enroll, but the course is fast-paced and meant to replicate a college introductory programming class (CSE 142 at the UW). Students are challenged to solve difficult problems and to develop multiple class projects. Students will learn topics that include procedural programming (methods, parameters, return values), basic control structures (sequence, if/else, loops), file processing, collections, object-oriented design, and recursion. This course prepares students to take the AP CS A Exam in May .

                        This course is designed to give students the opportunity to explore the world of robotics through the basic principles of design, construction, and programming of robots while learning problem-solving techniques, mathematics, logic, creativity, physics, electronics, mechanics, teamwork, computers and computer programming. The class is structured for both technical and non-technical students. Students will first learn how the basic components of a robot operate and then learn to join them together to form a robot that can complete simple functions. Students will use VEX Robot kits to design, build, test and modify their own robots. In the labs, students either individually or as teams will be challenged to construct robots that will perform a series of tasks. The goal of the class is to provide students the opportunity to apply science, math, technology, and engineering skills and concepts to something which is both challenging and fun.
